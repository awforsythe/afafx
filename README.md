This repository contains After Effects (AFX) scripts written by me, Alex Forsythe (AF). These are quick-and-dirty tools that are only as polished as I need them to be for my own use. They're provided without warranty.

## Development Setup

The basic development and testing workflow uses Visual Studio code. To test the project:

1. In vscode, ensure that the [ExtendScript Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Adobe.extendscript-debug) extension is installed
2. Open the vscode workspace
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+P &rarr; Select the target application &rarr; After Effects 2020
4. Press F5, and the main script should run in After Effects.
